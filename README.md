# TinyHomeLighting
Just a simple Arduino Sketch for my Tiny Home Lighting system


So I need some light in my tiny home! But not just any lights, I want a nerdy LED system to reflect my weirdness. I may also use the Arduino that is driving the lights to make a crude security system once they are up and running. 

Feature List: 
  - Place a magnetic sensor to determine when the door is being opened
  - Use a photocell to determine when it is light and dard outside to give the appropriate color lighting upon entering the trailer for the "main" lights 
  - set asside a little strip of lights for a binary clock
  - add a thermometer and use the temperature to determine the color of some lights near the door
   
   
  _More Outlandishy features_
  - add a tiny speaker that chimes within 30 sec if I don't hit a hidden button just inside the door
  - Motion sensors for each corner that then lights up a small LED in that corner to capture movement outside in a crude way
